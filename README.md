## Question 2
The second question of the Homework 4 concerns feature engeneering, dimensionality reduction and clsutering. In details, starting from a dataset about the Netflix's accesses by users from Kaggle, the users has been grouped by in oreder to have for each row a unique user and then 15 new features has been created starting from the original features. Talking about the dimensinality reduction part, 2 techniques has been imlemented: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Factor Analysis for Mixed Data (FAMD), just this second technique has been used to perform the kmeans algorithm and this choice is justified by its characteristic of dealing with datasets that cointain both numberical and categorical features. Finally, a kmeans algorithm has been implemented from scratch, firstly without the random inizialization and then with it, together with 2 methods to find the optimal number of clsuters. Is also present another clustering alorithm suggested by ChatGPT with some considerations about. The last part of the code is dedicated to analysis of the results through the pivot tables.
